# SmartBuy
#### (or Product + Intelligence = proInduct or inductLi(gence)? HuntAssistant?)

The "scanned" image is my general idea, basically a product research (when you're finding the right product to buy) assistant that does the work for you.
###### stand-out feature {#review_pulling}
The really important feature that might be a bit complicated is automatically finding suitable sections of reviews like this from [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/asus-vivobook-s15-s532f)

### starting with laptops, Amazon
For now I'm mostly going to start with laptops, as that's the problem that inspired the idea, but in the future, I might explore a general algorithm for different types of products.
Also, for the price research part, I'm *probably* first just going to compare listings within Amazon, as I believe Amazon has an API for such comparing.

## Learning Goals
I will probably practice JavaScript or Python, as it will probably be a webapp. I will get quite a bit of experience with **web crawling/aggregating** for the comparison stuff, as well as **searching databases**.
One goal is ranking a few top products, including that match most, but not all specifications wanted, so I'll need to write some **ranking & comparison algorithms**.
I will likely have to learn **Natural Language Processing**(machine learning) for [the "stand-out" feature](#review_pulling), for identifying relevant sections of review pages/blog posts.
